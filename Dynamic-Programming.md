## How to- DP:

- Define recursive subproblems: break problem into parts such that subproblem looks like the problem itself
- Guess part of the solution, count the number of choices
- Combine or relate subproblems to the complete solution
- Memoize
- 

## Longest Palindromic Subsequence

- Given a string, find length of longest subsequence that is palindromic

### First approach

Brute Force: Find all possible subsequences, find largest palindromic subsequence, O(n^2)

### Better: Use Dynamic Programming
